    "# 🌱 Pivotal Future - recruitment task\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is to test both your python and ML skills, and your ability to think critically about a\n",
    "problem. A set of tasks is given below. Please summarise your findings in a short report (see instructions in the last section), and attach any code you use in your analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do not spend more than 8 hours on the task. Read carefully all the sections, and then complete as you many sections as you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either run the code locally on your machine, or use https://colab.google/ if you need GPU resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌼 Background \n",
    "At Pivotal, we leverage AI for biodiversity measurement and monitoring. *Plants* are fundamental to ecosystems, serving as primary producers that support all life forms. Monitoring plant species and their distributions provides critical insights into ecosystem health, climate change effects, and biodiversity patterns. Accurate identification of plant species is essential for effective conservation efforts. However, plant identification presents challenges due to high variability in morphology, seasonal changes, and environmental influences. Leaves, flowers, bark, and growth patterns can vary significantly within species, making classification complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about plants on the [iNaturalist page](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/47126-Plantae). You can explore identification techniques under the Observations section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🖊️ The task\n",
    "In this task, you will train and test a single-label classifier to distinguish between different species of plants, utilizing machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is divided in the following parts:\n",
    "1. Load and explore the dataset\n",
    "2. Train the classification model\n",
    "3. Evaluate the model\n",
    "4. Bonus part (not mandatory)\n",
    "5. Questions for report\n",
    "\n",
    "We reccomend to read every section first, and then to start coding."

    "3. What data augmentation techniques should be used for this particular dataset\n",

    "5. Did you find any patterns in the errors made by the model during the validation? \n",
    "6. In the wild, it is rare that we are able to neatly separate individual plant species into single images, how would you change your model to be used as a multi-label classifier to be able to predict multiple species per image, and what kind of data would you need?\n",
