    "# 🌱 Pivotal Future - recruitment task\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is to test both your python and ML skills, and your ability to think critically about a\n",
    "problem. A set of tasks is given below. Please summarise your findings in a short report (see instructions in the last section), and attach any code you use in your analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do not spend more than 8 hours on the task. Read carefully all the sections, and then complete as you many sections as you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either run the code locally on your machine, or use https://colab.google/ if you need GPU resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🐸 Background \n",
    "\n",
    "At Pivotal, we leverage AI for biodiversity measurement and monitoring. *Frogs* are vital indicators of environmental health due to their sensitivity to ecological changes. Monitoring their populations provides insights into ecosystem integrity and biodiversity. Accurate identification of frog species through their vocalizations is essential for effective conservation efforts. There is a high variability in frog calls. They differ based on the species (each species has a unique vocalization), type of call (mating calls, territorial calls, distress calls). This makes the task of identifying the different species challenging\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about frogs in the [iNaturalist page](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/20979-Anura). You can read more about their vocalization under the *Calls* section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🖊️ The task\n",
    "In this task, you will train and test a binary classifier to distinguish between audio recordings of frog calls and other sounds, utilizing machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is divided in the following parts:\n",
    "1. Load and explore the dataset\n",
    "2. Train a binary classifier model\n",
    "3. Evaluate the model\n",
    "4. Bonus part (not mandatory)\n",
    "5. Questions for report\n",
    "\n",
    "We reccomend to read every section first, and then to start coding."
